Additional features of this solution are security applications, the main being detecting ‘tailgaters’ into buildings. This is where an unauthorised visitor gains access to the building by following an authorised member in.



A safety feature that they also offer is employee mustering, being able to detect how many people are in locations in case of evacuation.

The overall system boasts 97-99% accuracy.

Density also prioritises user privacy, quoting that ‘78% of surveyed employees aren’t comfortable with cameras for non-security use cases’

To combat this, density claims that they don’t capture personally identifiable information
