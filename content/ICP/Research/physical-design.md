The aim of the physical devices is set and forget. Once installed in place they shouldn't need to be touch physically and should be left alone. In this section we will look into possible designs to achieve this.

## Don't touch

A number of methods can be used to make people not tamper with objects. One of these is to make it extremely obvious that you want people not to touch it. This can be achieved by bright "warning colours" such as yellows and red and visible written or iconic warnings such as "DON'T TOUCH". This, whilst effective, can be quite distracting, which is not something wanted in study spaces where you want people to stay focused on their work. 

Another approach is making it so boring that people don't want to touch it and that it blends in with the majority of the other devices around. For our prototype designs we attempted to sketch up devices that are based off existing devices found in these spaces so that they will blend in . The first of these (1) is a device which is meant to look like a powerline adapter or air freshener. The hope behind this is that people know what these items are and therefore wont be interested enough in it to mess with it. By containing an internal power supply it should reduce the number of parts that can be tampered with.

The second design hopes to reduce tampering altogether by removing it by arms reach. Here the unit is designed to be ceiling mounted with the power supply elsewhere. With this design the unit should become pretty much impossible to mess with for the average person. The downside of this design is that it requires significant overhead compared to the other one. Number one can just be plugged into the socket where as number two requires someone to come install it on the ceiling.

As can be seen in the sketch above the unit can be broken down into only a few components. A PI/Arduino as the driver, environmental sensing unit and power supply. With design one we hope to include an interchangeable power supply which can be clicked on and off without the need for rewiring the plug. This is inspired by multiple products out on the market out, such as apples mac book charger. Also note the vents in the outer box for ventilation to allow the environmental sensors to function. Below is the internals for the second design.

When it comes to designing the outer case for the unit we hope to 3D print the box in two parts which can be clicked together. This can be seen below.
